## A Recent History of Language AI
- A peek into the history of Language AI. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250227174648.png)
- Language AI is capable of many tasks by processing textual input. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250228155103.png)
- A vocabulary is created by retaining all unique words across both sentences. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250228155659.png)
- A bag-of-words is created by counting individual words. These values are referred to as vector representations. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250228160147.png)
- A neural network is trained to predict if two words are neighbours. During this process, the embeddings are updated to be in line with the ground truth. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250228163425.png)
- The values of embeddings represent properties that are used to represent words. We may oversimplify by imagining that dimensions represent concepts (which they don't), but it helps express the idea. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250228164114.png)
- Embeddings of words that are similar will be close to each other in dimensional space. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250228164712.png)
- Embeddings can be created for different types of input. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250308225251.png)
- Two recurrent neural networks (decoder and encoder) translating an input sequence from English to Dutch. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250309140722.png)
